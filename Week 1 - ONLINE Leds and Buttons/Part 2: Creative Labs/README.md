# Church
Like the ancient people who worshipped the gods of the earth and the sun due to their limited cognition and survival dependence, one day in the future, when the Internet world penetrates people’s lives to an unprecedented level, the Internet has become an existence that people cannot understand. Will we also worship the Internet that we can't live without?

Based on this, I tried to construct a virtual future Internet religion, create doctrines, and religious worship rituals.

## The Worship ceremony
Every time the followers hit the keyboard（button）, they will get God's response —— The vibration of the altar(which is the network equipment of the followers) gives them the strength and sublimation of their souls, everyone can worship, and God treats everyone equally.

As the number of hits by all followers increases, the vibration of the altar will become more intense, and it will not return to calm until enough vibrations are caused in the network.

In this work, the blue LED light simulates each vibration of the altar, and the red LED light on the right records the current degree of vibration, and it will reset when it accumulates to the third stage.

## Doctrines
“The central doctrine of Internet Gods believes that the entire online world is built by an indescribable supernatural being (Internet God). After the Internet God expelled the right of other gods to access the Internet, he alone controlled the entire Internet world.”

“Internet believers dare to speak everything on the Internet because they are blessed by the keyboard god. Compared with the mutual suspicion of people in reality, the magic of the god can easily change other people’s ideas and get their approval more easily .”

“All news events on the Internet are witnessed by the Internet God and spread to his people, There's no need to question its authenticity.”

“When the world was created, the Internet god first created a keyboard and a computer connected to the network cable.”

“Global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are caused by people in reality who consume too many real resources and fail to devote themselves to the online world.”
