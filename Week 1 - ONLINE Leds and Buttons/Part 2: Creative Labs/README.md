# Church
Like the ancient people who worshipped the gods of the earth and the sun due to their limited cognition and survival dependence, one day in the future, when the Internet world penetrates peopleâ€™s lives to an unprecedented level, the Internet has become an existence that people cannot understand. Will we also worship the Internet that we can't live without?/n
Based on this, I tried to construct a virtual future Internet religion, create doctrines, and religious worship rituals.
